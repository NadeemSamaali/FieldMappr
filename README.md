# FieldMappr
Console based software mapping electric fields in three dimensions with the help of user inputted configuration of points, rods and/or rings of charge.

### **Model and Numerical Methods**

For the code, important libraries were imported to obtain the desired output. These libraries are numpy, matplotlib.pyplot,  Axes3D. To obtain the electric field,  Coulomb’s constant was specified as k to be able to simplify the code. This constant has a value of $8.99 \times 10^9$ and is necessary to calculate the electric field of point charges. The three dimensional bounds of the simulation are defined to have a minimum value of $-25$ and a maximum value of $25$ for the axis $x$, $y$ and $z$, which allows us to see the electric field clearly compared to the size of the point charges, rods and ring present. This size was determined because it is not too big in a way where the charges aren’t clear and not too small where the electric field is incomprehensible. The step size has a value of $6.25$, which allows the graph to have a good resolution and the code to computate rather quickly.  To show the electric field, many functions are used. These functions are stored in a class created named $E_{map}$ which will allow the visualization of the electric field. This will allow the creation of different graphs for different types of arrangements more quickly. In addition, the class $E_{map}$ containts a list named *charge_map*, where each point charge used in the simulation will be stored.
